The book aims to equip readers with the knowledge and skills to develop high-performance embedded systems using the KRIA platform.

## Introduction to the Book Parts

### Part A: Fundamental Technologies
This section will lay the groundwork by exploring the essential technologies you'll need to master in order to work effectively with the KRIA KR260 kit. We will cover programming languages like RUST, Python, and C/C++, which are vital for software development. Additionally, youâ€™ll be introduced to VHDL and Verilog, the hardware description languages crucial for FPGA design and development.

### Part B: KRIA Hardware and Board Bring-Up
In this part, we dive into the specifics of the KRIA hardware. You'll learn how to bring up the board, customize the Linux image, and ensure that your environment is ready for development. This section is crucial for setting the stage for subsequent development tasks.

### Part C: IP Core Development for Ultrascale FPGA Family
This section focuses on the development of IP cores specifically for the Ultrascale FPGA family. We'll explore the powerful tools in Vivado, guide you through creating your own IPs, and introduce you to ready-to-use IPs within the Vivado ecosystem.

### Part D: Integrating IP with Custom Linux Core
Here, we will merge software and hardware worlds by integrating the IP cores developed in Part C with a custom Linux core. This part is pivotal as it covers the interaction between hardware design and software control, ensuring a seamless workflow.

### Part E: RISC-V Architecture Implementation
In this part, we'll take a deep dive into implementing the RISC-V architecture. You'll learn how to customize it using Vivado, understanding the flexibility and power of RISC-V in the context of embedded systems.

### Part F: Running Dual OS Kernels on KRIA SOM Processors
The final part of the book will introduce advanced concepts, including running two OS kernels on the KRIA SOM processors. This section will provide you with the knowledge to leverage the full capabilities of the KRIA platform in complex, multi-OS environments.
