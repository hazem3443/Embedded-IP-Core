# Chapter 1 - RUST

## 1.1 Installing `rustup` on Linux or macOS

    If you’re using Linux or WSL, open a terminal and enter the following command:

    ```console
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    ```

    Linux users should generally install GCC or Clang, according to their
    distribution’s documentation. For example, if you use Ubuntu, you can install
    the `build-essential` package.

    To check whether you have Rust installed correctly, open a shell and enter this
    line:

    ```console
    $ rustc --version
    ```

    You should see the version number, commit hash, and commit date for the latest
    stable version that has been released, in the following format:

    ```text
    rustc x.y.z (abcabcabc yyyy-mm-dd)
    ```

    If you see this information, you have installed Rust successfully! If you don’t
    see this information, check that Rust is in your `%PATH%` system variable as
    follows.

    ```console
    $ echo $PATH
    ```

    If that’s all correct and Rust still isn’t working, there are a number of
    places you can get help. Find out how to get in touch with other community members on [the community page][community].

    Once Rust is installed via `rustup`, updating to a newly released version is
    easy. From your shell, run the following update script:

    ```console
    $ rustup update
    ```

    To uninstall Rust and `rustup`, run the following uninstall script from your
    shell:

    ```console
    $ rustup self uninstall
    ```
